**When We Use Them:** When you need to map a domain to an AWS resource.

**How We Use Them:**
- **Creating Alias Records:** Go to your hosted zone, click **Create Record Set**, select **Alias**, and choose the target AWS resource.

**Where To Use Them:** Use alias records to integrate Route 53 with AWS services and streamline DNS management.

---

## **8. Route 53 Resolver**

**What It Is:** A service that provides DNS resolution for VPCs and on-premises networks.

**Why We Use It:** To enable DNS resolution between your VPCs and on-premises networks.

**When We Use It:** When integrating DNS resolution between cloud and on-premises environments.

**How We Use It:**
- **Setting Up Route 53 Resolver Rules:** Configure rules for forwarding DNS queries between your VPC and on-premises DNS servers.

**Where To Use It:** Implement resolver rules for hybrid cloud environments where DNS resolution between AWS and on-premises systems is required.

# Additional Amazon Route 53 Terms Explained

---

## **9. Record Set**

**What It Is:** An individual DNS record within a hosted zone, such as A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, or PTR.

**Why We Use It:** To specify how domain names should resolve to IP addresses or other resources.

**When We Use It:** Whenever you need to define or modify the DNS records for a domain.

**How We Use It:**
- **Creating Record Sets:** In your hosted zone, click **Create Record Set**, choose the record type, and provide the necessary details.
- **Updating Record Sets:** Modify existing records as needed to reflect changes in your infrastructure or services.

**Where To Use It:** Use record sets to direct traffic to various services, including web servers, email servers, and other resources.

---

## **10. Failover Routing Policy**

**What It Is:** A routing policy that directs traffic to a primary resource but automatically fails over to a secondary resource if the primary fails.

**Why We Use It:** To ensure high availability and business continuity by redirecting traffic in case of failures.

**When We Use It:** When you need to maintain service availability by automatically switching to a backup resource during outages.

**How We Use It:**
- **Configuring Failover Records:** Create two records, one for the primary resource and one for the failover resource, and set the appropriate health check and failover settings.

**Where To Use It:** Implement failover routing for critical applications where uninterrupted service is essential.

---

## **11. Weighted Routing Policy**

**What It Is:** A routing policy that distributes traffic among multiple resources based on assigned weights.
