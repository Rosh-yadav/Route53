   - **Steps:**
     1. Go to **Hosted Zones** in the Route 53 console.
     2. Click **Create Record Set**.
     3. Select **Weighted Routing**.
     4. Assign weights to different resources and save.
   - **Why Use:** Helps in managing traffic distribution and testing different versions of applications.

2. **Latency Routing**
   - **Scenario:** Direct users to the nearest endpoint to reduce latency.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Create a new record set.
     2. Choose **Latency Routing**.
     3. Specify the regions and target resources.
   - **Why Use:** Enhances user experience by reducing response times.

3. **Failover Routing**
   - **Scenario:** Automatically redirect traffic to a backup site in case of primary site failure.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Create a new record set.
     2. Choose **Failover Routing**.
     3. Define primary and secondary resources, and configure health checks.
   - **Why Use:** Ensures high availability and disaster recovery.

4. **Geolocation Routing**
   - **Scenario:** Route users based on their geographic location.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Create a new record set.
     2. Choose **Geolocation Routing**.
     3. Define geographic regions and corresponding endpoints.
   - **Why Use:** Delivers region-specific content and complies with local regulations.

#### **2.2 Health Checks and DNS Failover**

**Feature:** Health Checks monitor the health of resources and enable DNS failover to ensure high availability.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Create and Configure Health Checks**
   - **Scenario:** Monitor the health of your web servers.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Go to **Health Checks**.
     2. Click **Create Health Check**.
     3. Define the endpoint, protocol, and health check criteria.
   - **Why Use:** Detects and responds to failures to maintain uptime.

2. **DNS Failover Configuration**
   - **Scenario:** Ensure automatic traffic redirection in case of server failure.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Configure health checks for primary and secondary resources.
     2. Set up failover routing with the primary and secondary records.
   - **Why Use:** Provides automatic recovery from failures.

#### **2.3 DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**

**Feature:** DNSSEC provides security for DNS by enabling data integrity and authenticity.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Enable DNSSEC**
   - **Scenario:** Protect DNS data from tampering and spoofing attacks.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Go to the hosted zone in Route 53.
     2. Click on **DNSSEC**.
     3. Enable DNSSEC and follow prompts for key signing.
   - **Why Use:** Enhances the security of your DNS infrastructure.

#### **2.4 Domain Registration and Management**

**Feature:** Route 53 allows you to register and manage domain names.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Register a New Domain**
   - **Scenario:** Acquire a new domain name for your website or application.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Go to **Domain Registration**.
     2. Click **Register Domain**.
     3. Follow the prompts to complete registration.
   - **Why Use:** Centralizes domain management within AWS.

2. **Transfer Existing Domain**
   - **Scenario:** Move an existing domain to Route 53 for unified management.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Go to **Domain Registration**.
     2. Click **Transfer Domain**.
     3. Follow instructions for domain transfer.
   - **Why Use:** Simplifies domain management and consolidation.

#### **2.5 Routing Policy Examples**

**Feature:** Detailed examples of how different routing policies can be applied.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Simple Routing Policy**
   - **Scenario:** Direct all traffic to a single resource.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Create a record set with **Simple Routing**.
     2. Enter the IP address or domain name.
   - **Why Use:** Basic and straightforward routing for single resource setups.

2. **Weighted Routing Policy**
   - **Scenario:** Split traffic between multiple servers.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Create a weighted record set.
     2. Assign different weights to each endpoint.
   - **Why Use:** Balances load and performs gradual rollouts of new features.
